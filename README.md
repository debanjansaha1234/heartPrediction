# Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
Heart disease is a leading cause of death worldwide, and early detection plays a crucial role in preventing complications and improving patient outcomes. Predictive models can assist healthcare professionals in identifying individuals at a higher risk of developing heart disease and give them early treatment making sure that more people can live healthy lives.This is where Machine Learning comes into play. Machine Learning helps in predicting the Heart diseases, and the predictions made are quite accurate

The project involved analysis of the heart disease patient dataset with proper data processing and analysis of various features affecting the heart dieases . Then, different models were trained and and predictions are made with different algorithms KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest,SVM to predict the result and best of the all models is selected for the model

In the end using the model I have created a GUI which asks for user inputs and predicts if the possibly have a heart diease or not
