# Heart-Disease-Prediction-using-Machine-Learning
The project involved analysis of the heart disease patient dataset with proper data processing and analysis of various features affecting the heart dieases . Then, different models were trained and and predictions are made with different algorithms KNN, Decision Tree, Random Forest,SVM to predict the result and best of the all models is selected for the model

In the end using the model I have created a GUI which asks for user inputs and predicts if the possibly have a heart diease or not
